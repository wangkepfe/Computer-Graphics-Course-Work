lab1
1) Setup and getting acquainted with the lab shell

1,Where is the origin placed in the on-screen coordinate system?

center

2,Which direction are the X and Y axes pointing in the on-screen coordinate system?

X to right
Y to up

3,The triangle color is controlled from the fragment shader. Would it be possible to control it from the main program? How?

yes. Upload control variables to fragment shader

2) Transformations in the vertex shader

1,What is the purpose of the "in", "out" and "uniform" modifiers?

"in" in vertex shader get input from main program,
"out" in vertex shader output to fragment shader;
"in" in fragment shader get input from vertex shader.
"out" in fragment shader output the color.
"uniform" is global, can be used both in vertex shader and fragment shader.

2,What is the output of the vertex shader?

the position of the vertices

3,What does the function glUniformMatrix4fv do?

upload a 4 by 4 float matrix to shaders.

3) Simple animation

What is the frame rate of the animation?
50fps

4) Color shading

1,Did you need to do anything different when uploading the color data?

pass the color data from main program to vertex shader, and then pass them to fragment shader

2,The "in" and "out" modifiers are now used for something different. What?

"in" in vertex shader get input from main program,
"out" in vertex shader output to fragment shader;
"in" in fragment shader get input from vertex shader.
"out" in fragment shader output the color.

3,What is this kind of shading called? What could we use otherwise?

color shading.
we can use light shading(diffuse, specular) otherwise.

5) Building a cube, visible surface detection

1,What problems did you encounter while building the cube?

no problems

2,How do you change the facing of a polygon?

using Z buffer

6) Load a 3D model from disc

1,Why do we need normal vectors for a model?

for lighting effect

2,What did you do in your fragment shader?

we used normal vector to calculate the color
out_color = vec4(myNormal[0],myNormal[1],myNormal[2],1);

3,Should a normal vector always be perpendicular to a certain triangle? If not, why?

yes.

4,Now we are using glBindBuffer and glBufferData again. They deal with buffers, but in what way?

bind the buffers to VAO
