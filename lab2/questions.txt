1) Procedural texture mapping

1,How are the textures coordinates mapped on the bunny? Can you see what geometry was used?

defined in model's texCoord data

2,What kind of procedural texture did you make?

out_Color = vec4(myTexCoord[0],myTexCoord[1],0.0f,1.0f);

2) Texture mapping

1,Can we modify how we access the texture? How?



2,Why can't we just pass the texture object to the shader? There is a specific reason for this, a limited resource. What?
